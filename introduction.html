    <h2>Vegetarian Ramen
    </h2>

    <p>This Vegetarian Ramen recipe is so full of umami that it's going to rock your world! Learn the secret of creating
        a super-rich & creamy broth without any meat bones. You'd be so glad that your homemade ramen is superior enough
        to rival the ramen shop. <br><br> <br>

        <q><i>I made this ramen last week, and it tasted so good! I couldn't believe how delicious it could be! I made
                it
                for
                seven people, and everyone loved it! I even made the ramen eggs. I'm not a vegetarian so I was
                definitely
                skeptical at first, but once I made it I knew it was a winner. It reminds me of Tonkotsu ramen flavour.
